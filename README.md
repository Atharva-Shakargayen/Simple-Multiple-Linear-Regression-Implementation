# Simple-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Implementation

Part A:Apply the Simple , Multiple  Linear regression  on 50_Startups.csv dataset  and polynomial Linear regression on Position_Salaries.csv dataset. Do the following:
1 .Visualizing the Training and Testing  set results
2. Encoding categorical data 
3.Visualising the Simple and Polynomial Regression results

Hint: Use "from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures" for polynomial regression.

Part B:
The goal is to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a student will be admitted to a university (admit = 1) or not (admit = 0) based on their GRE score, GPA, and the prestige of the undergraduate institution they attended.Dataset:
You are provided with a dataset containing information on applicants to a university. The dataset includes the following features:
A standardized test score used for graduate admissions (out of 340).
Grade Point Average during undergraduate studies (on a scale of 0 to 4).
Ranked from 1 to 4, with 1 being the most prestigious.
Binary variable indicating whether the student was admitted (1) or not (0).
Example Dataset:
GRE Score (X1)             GPA (X2)            Prestige (X3)             Admission Status (Y)
330                          3.8                         2                             1
300                          3.4                         3                             0
320                          3.5                         2                             1
310                          3.2                          4                             0
340                          3.9                          1                             1
